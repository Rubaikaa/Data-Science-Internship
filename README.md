# Project Title
# 🎯 Data Science Internship Tasks

Welcome to the **Data Science Internship** repository! 🚀 This repository contains hands-on tasks designed to enhance skills in **exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and data processing**.

## 📌 Tasks Overview
### 📝 Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization
# 🚀 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover key insights.

🔹 **Features:**
- ✅ Data Cleaning (handling missing values, outliers)
- ✅ Interactive Visualizations (histograms, bar charts)
- ✅ Correlation Analysis (heatmaps)
- ✅ Widget-based Passenger Filtering

📊 **Interactive Notebook:**

## 📌 Key Insights
- Most passengers traveled in **3rd class** (budget-friendly).
- Majority of passengers were aged **20-30 years**.
- Higher fares are **positively correlated** with survival.
- Missing values were handled effectively.

## 📌 Objective
Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify text as positive or negative. This involves preprocessing text, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠️ Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF or word embeddings
- Model training using Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes
- Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)

## 📂 Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
# Run the script
python sentiment_analysis.py --input "This movie was amazing!"
```

## 🔍 Example Output
```
Input: "This movie was amazing!"
Predicted Sentiment: Positive
Accuracy: 89.5%
```

## 🏗️ Model Training
```bash
python train_model.py --dataset imdb_reviews.csv
```

## 📊 Evaluation
```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```
### 🔍 Task 3: Fraud Detection System
# Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a **fraud detection system** using **machine learning** to classify credit card transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**. It uses the **Credit Card Fraud Dataset**, applies **data preprocessing**, handles class imbalance with **SMOTE**, and trains a **Random Forest model** to detect fraud.

## 🚀 Features
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, normalization, and class balancing.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses **Random Forest** for classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures **precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- **Interactive Testing**: Allows users to input transaction data for real-time fraud detection.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is `creditcard.csv`, which contains anonymized transaction data with features like `Time`, `Amount`, and `V1-V28`.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection.git
   cd fraud-detection
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. **Run the fraud detection script:**
   ```bash
   python fraud_detection.py
   ```

## 📊 Model Training & Evaluation
The model is trained on processed data, and evaluated using:
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

## 🛠 Usage
### Running the System
To manually test a transaction, use:
```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```
Enter transaction details as prompted.

### Example Automated Test
Modify the script to test with a predefined transaction:
```python
example_transaction = X_test[0].reshape(1, -1)
prediction = model.predict(example_transaction)
print("Prediction:", "Fraudulent" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Legitimate")
```

## 🤖 Future Enhancements
- Implementing **deep learning** models.
- Deploying the model as a **REST API**.
- Creating a **web-based dashboard** for monitoring.

### 🏡 Task 4: Predicting House Prices (California Housing Dataset)

## 🚀 Features of This Script
✅ Custom Linear Regression & Random Forest Implementations

✅ Preprocessing: Normalization & Categorical Encoding

✅ Performance Metrics: RMSE & R² Score

✅ Graphical Comparison of Model Performance

## 📥 Dataset Information
The dataset is from the **California Housing Dataset**, containing features like:
- `longitude`, `latitude` - Location coordinates
- `housing_median_age` - Median age of houses
- `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms` - Number of rooms and bedrooms
- `median_income` - Median income of residents
- `ocean_proximity` - Categorical feature (distance from ocean)
- `median_house_value` - Target variable (House Price)
